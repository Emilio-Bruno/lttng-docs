Welcome to the **LTTng Documentation**!

The _Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation_ is an open source software
toolkit used to simultaneously trace the Linux kernel, user applications,
and user libraries. LTTng consists of <<lttng-modules,kernel modules>>
(for Linux kernel tracing) and dynamically loaded
<<lttng-ust,libraries>> (for user application and library tracing).
A <<lttng-sessiond,session daemon>> controls the LTTng tracers after it
receives commands from the <<lttng-cli,cmd:lttng command-line
tool>>.
