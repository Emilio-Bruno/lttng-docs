=== Target audience

The material of this documentation is appropriate for intermediate to
advanced software developers working in a Linux environment and
interested in efficient software tracing. LTTng is also worth a
try for students interested in the inner mechanics of their systems.

If you do not have a programming background, you may wish to skip
everything related to instrumentation, which often requires at least
some programming language skills.
