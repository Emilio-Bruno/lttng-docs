A few people made the online LTTng Documentation possible.

http://eepp.ca/[Philippe Proulx] wrote most of the content, created
the diagrams, and formatted the document. He is the current maintainer
of the LTTng Documentation.

Daniel U. Thibault, from the DRDC, wrote an open guide called _LTTng:
The Linux Trace Toolkit Next Generation{nbsp}&#8212;{nbsp}A
Comprehensive User's Guide (version 2.3 edition)_ which was used
to complete parts of the <<core-concepts,Core concepts>> and
<<plumbing,Components of LTTng>> sections and for a few passages here
and there.

The entire http://www.efficios.com/[EfficiOS] team made essential reviews
of the whole document.

We sincerely thank everyone who helped enhance the quality of this
documentation.
