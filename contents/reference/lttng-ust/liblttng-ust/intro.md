The LTTng-UST library, or `liblttng-ust`, is the main shared object
against which user applications are linked to make LTTng user space
tracing possible.

The [C application](#doc-c-application) guide shows the complete
process to instrument, build and run a C/C++ application using
LTTng-UST, while this section contains a few important tables.
