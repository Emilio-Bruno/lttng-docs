If you're going to use LTTng in any serious way, it is fundamental that
you become familiar with its core concepts. Technical terms like
_tracing sessions_, _domains_, _channels_ and _events_ are used over
and over in the [Using LTTng](#doc-using-lttng) chapter,
and it is assumed that you understand what they mean when reading it.

LTTng, as you already know, is a _toolkit_. It would be wrong
to call it a simple _tool_ since it is composed of multiple interacting
components. This chapter also describes the latter, providing details
about their respective roles and how they connect together to form
the current LTTng ecosystem.
