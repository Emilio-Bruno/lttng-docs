Debian wheezy (stable) and previous versions are not supported; you will
need to build and install LTTng packages
[from source](#doc-building-from-source) for those.

Debian jessie (testing) and sid (unstable) have everything you need:

<pre class="term">
sudo apt-get install lttng-tools lttng-modules-dkms liblttng-ust-dev
</pre>
